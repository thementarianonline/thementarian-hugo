August 19th. The sounds of marching feet echoed loudly through the morning air, though these sounds came not from the boots of soldiers, but from the disciplined students of Mentari’s flag-hoisting troop (Paskibra), standing proudly in honor and remembrance of the birth of our republic. To conclude our Independence Day celebrations, which began with previous events such as Red & White Day, we paid silent tribute to and commended the contributions of the honorable heroes of our past during this formal ceremony. Our flag-hoisting troop had been rigorously preparing themselves for this ceremony for slightly over a week, beginning on August 8th.
The flag-raising ceremony took place at 8 AM sharp in the SMP parking lot. Mentarians of all grades proudly gathered under the sun to express their love and admiration for the nation, together singing our national anthem, "Indonesia Raya." Additionally, the five founding principles of our nation, known as Pancasila, and the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia were also read to all, a reminder of what it means to be Indonesian. Alongside the ceremony, Sir Timothy also delivered an inspiring speech on the significance of our Independence day, emphasizing its role in inspiring the future leaders of our nation, a role and station that all Mentarians should aspire to and proudly serve in whenever called upon to do so.
